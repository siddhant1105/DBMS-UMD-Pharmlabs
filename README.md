# DBMS UMD - Pharmlabs
 We want to build an effective database for Pharm Labs. To do that, we need to implement detailed data about individual elements of the business. Based on the information Pharmlabs has provided us, it is pertinent that we include detailed information about the client, sales and employees. After analyzing the sample data and catalog provided by Pharmlabs, it is clear that the company has a wide variety of products available to the client and many orders of each product sold, with varieties. With a catalog this varied and with a large amount of data, we are building a database, along with the goals mentioned below, in order to simplify data collection and improve data searching and filtering. As the data is currently presented, it is overly long and difficult to search. Using the entity relationship model, we can separate the data as necessary based on the information Pharmlabs has provided classifying each attribute into separate tables, or entities.
